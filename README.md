## Project Description

This project is an adaptation of the Mission Demolition project from the Bond book. It implements the project as stated in the book, along with a few enhancements.

This game 

The biggest enhancement (and what makes it coolest in my opinion) is the "good ending" that I added. If a player completes all four levels in under 25 shots, they will get the good ending.
This is a challenging task, as most of the castles take quite a few attempts to reach the goal if they are not broken down correctly. Theoretically, a player could complete all four levels
in as few as 10 or so shots, but I made the goal 25 to give all players a chance.
